# Commenting System With React

## Feature implement in this app

- Can choose and switch users to manage comments (each user can only delete comments on their own)
- Comments are nested in one layer, so you cannot reply to child comments
- For loading all comments, I used the infinite scrolling system
- This project does not have an API call and starts with dummy data (all is CSR)
- You can reply to parental comments.
- You can remove each comment (if it is a parent, all children are also removed)
